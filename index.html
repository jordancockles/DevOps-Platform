            <h1> Welcome to the DevOps Platform </h1>
            </br>
            <p>The DevOps platform is a suite of tooling designed and applied in a way that enables the utilisation and engagement of the DevOps ideology.
            This platform is available to use for any project in an organisation and aims to give projects the capacity for smarter planning, greater collaboration
            and faster deliveries of software. This means projects can spend more time improving their processes and generate more business value.</p>
            </br>
            <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
            </br>
            <p>DevOps is a culture of people that engage in a mindset of agility and continuous improvement. They do this by leveraging tooling and processes
            that will increase collaboration between teams and increase the velocity of product delivery. By engaging in this philosophy, an organisation can 
            respond to changing requirements with greater agility and provide more business value with every product delivery.</p>

            <h1>Gerrit</h1>
            <img src="../img/gerrit-logo.png">
            <p>Gerrit is a source code management and collaboration tool. It allows teams to centralise source code in a single location providing 
            projects with a "single source of truth" for application source code. Source code management (SCM) is where modifications to source 
            code is tracked and a running history of the changes to the code is maintained, thus allowing there to be a continuous audit trail of how the 
            code has evolved over time.</p>

            <p>SCM solves several key problems with application development. Over time, multiple contributors alter the source code and the complexity of 
            the project increases. As edits are made to the source code the developers need to merge their code changes together and resolve conflicts.
            When done manually, this is a very time consuming and complicated process. SCM tools like Gerrit perform all the heavy lifting on detecting
            conflicts during merges and safeguards the centralised version of source code from merge errors.</p>

            <p>Other benefits of using Gerrit for source code management include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code review By peers ensuring code quality</li>
                <li>Tagging & labelling for easy traceability</li>
                <li>Branching for managing code variants</li>
                <li>Key starting point for continuous integration</li>
                <li>Revert to previous versions of code</li>

            <h1>Jenkins</h1>
            <img src="../img/jenkins-logo.png">
            <p>Jenkins is an automation tool. Its predominant purpose is enabling the use of continuous delivery for software development projects. Continous delivery
            is where software is automatically built, tested and released. This enables teams to reliably release software in shorter cycles and at any time. The aim
            is to increase the frequency and speed of software delivery which reduces the cost, time and risk of delivering changes.<p>

            <p>In its purest form, continuous delivery can detect a code change in a source code repository and automate its delivery into the production system. This
            is achieved when there is full trust and confidence in the delivery pipeline. Trust gained through a rigorous approach to fully automating the required
            testing and analysis of the code change through QA, SIT and UAT.</p>

            <p>Other benefits of using Jenkins include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flexible automation for deployments to most platforms</li>
                <li>Integrates with most testing frameworks including jUnit, Selenium and Cypress</li>
                <li>Can be used to build several types of applications including .NET, Maven & Java</li>
                <li>Can automate server configuration enabling server hardening</li>
                <li>Highly customizable automation from CI/CD to infrastructure as code deployment</li>
                <li>Currently deploying to Windows, Linux, Appian, Mulesoft, Acquia</li>

            <h1>SonarQube</h1>
            <img src="../img/sonar-logo.png">
            <p>SonarQube is a code quality analysis tool. It allows for the scanning of source code and produces a comprehensive report describing the "hygiene" of the code.
            The report will highlight where there are any critical issues in the code that could cause security vulnerabilities or functional errors with the application.
            In addition to this it will also highlight any code sniffs where the code does not adhere to standardised best practice of code development.</p>

            <p>The purpose of verifying the quality of source code is to ensure that any critical issues are detected before they are introduced to a production
            environment and also ensures that the developers adhere to a common coding practice. Having a standardised code format ensures that it remains maintainable
            throughout the lifecycle of the software. When the scan is baked into a continuous delivery pipeline it ensures that any issues with the code are detected
            often resulting in the reduction of tecnical debt.</p>

            <p>Other benefits of using SonarQube include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quality gates prevent poor quality code being deployed</li>
                <li>Reduces complexity, vulnerabilities and duplications</li>
                <li>Reduces time spent retrospectivley correcting code</li>
                <li>Customisable quality profiles and gates enables fine tuning of agreeable code quality</li>
                <li>Regular feedback helps developers improve their coding quality latently</li>

            <img src="../img/nexus-logo.png">
            <p>SonarQube is a repository manager. It allows for the archiving and versioning of artifacts and binaries such as exe, jar, pom and zip files.
            It also manages the dependencies of a project that use public dependency repositories including Maven and Nuget. It also connects to private
            dependency repositories that are vendor provided.</p>

            <p>The primary purpose of Nexus is to have a place where all of a projects dependencies and artifacts are centrally located. This allows for
            easier access to the artifacts when using CI/CD for deployments and ensures there is an audit of historical versions of applications. It also
            means there is one central repository that the CI/CD pipelines can use for retrieving project dependencies.</p>

            <p>Other benefits of using Nexus include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cached dependencies means faster builds</li>
                <li>Predicatbility and stability as cached dependencies do not need the external repository to be available</li>
                <li>Bandwidth savings as there are less connection requests to external repositories</li>
                <li>Control and auditing of application artifacts</li>

            <p>Kibana is the front end of the Elastic stack. The Elastic Stack is a suite of products that aims to take data from any source and allow users
            to format, search, analyze and visualise the data in real time. The Elastic Stack is highly flexible in the data that it can process and standardised
            data can be provided through the use of Elastic Beats. The Elastic Beats are Metricbeat; which provides data based on machine resource usage including
            CPU and disk space, Filebeat; which reads logs and as they are updated processes each new line of the log, Packetbeat; which analyses network packets
            monitoring the traffic between servers, Auditbeat; which monitors user activity and analyzes event data and Heartbeat; which monitors the uptime of
            applications and services.</p>

            <p>The primary purpose of the Elastic Stack is to provide visualisations on data so that teams can make educated decisions based on the analysed data.
            It can also be used to produce dashboards for continuous monitoring, enabling for more visible and easier to manage operations.</p>

            <p>Selenium is an automated testing framework that validates web applications across different browsers and platforms. It is used for end to end testing
            where the interactions such as selecting buttons and filling in forms in a web browser are automated. Selenium tests can be developed in multiple
            programming languages including Java, and Python. </p>

            <p>The primary purpose of Selenium is to enable more frequent and consistent testing of browser applications. This, when integrated into CI/CD pipelines,
            allows for the increased velocity of software deliveries as testing is automatically performed instead of being done manually by a tester. The Selenium
            tests will instantaneoulsy report if parts of the application are functioning as required.</p>

            with customisable workflows, effort and work estimation and several built in reports that visualise the status and progress of a project.</p>

            <p>The primary purpose of JIRA is to give teams a centralised location where they can track the status of a variety of projects with differing
            complexities. Smaller projects can leverage a simple Kanban board for tracking tasks and which team members are performing the tasks. Projects
            with the aim of producing a software, application or system can utilise a more complex project that allows them to track stories, bugs and test
            cases through the different stages of project development from backlog, development, SIT, UAT and done.</p>
